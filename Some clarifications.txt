These are my favourite projects, that I've managed to steal some time to make :) They might be a bit naive, but are the most complicated things I've attempted to do so far. The Graph project is still on the go, because it is very ambitious, but it has some ready functionality. The priority queue is tested and works fine and can be readily used. The geometric methods are ready, but only some basic tests have been done and need more thorough testing. The BinarySearchTree is the latest project and it is also flawed, but as I was more advanced when I did it, it has perhaps a better flow than the rest.
