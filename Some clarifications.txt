These are my favourite projects, that I've managed to steal some time to make :) The Graph project is still on the go, because it is a bit too ambitious for my level, but it has some ready functionality. The priority queue is tested and works fine and can be readily used. The geometric methods are ready, but only some basic tests have been done and need more thorough testing. The BinarySearchTree is the latest project and it is also flawed, but as I was more advanced when I did it, it has perhaps a better flow than the rest. The Dwarf game is something I did as a Homework assignment for the Telerik Academy. It is simple and doesn't make as much use of OOP as it should, but at that time we had not yet studied the OOP principles. Despite this, I managed to slip in some classes that I had begun to study on my own.
